    title: 'A Somatic Experience of Flirting',
    description:
      'If you combine authenticity, embodiment and play - you get a powerful recipe for flirting. 🔥😏 This is a somatic exploration of the masks we carry in flirting, what inhibits us, and how we can play with different energies, the risk of no, and agendas in flirting. I find it INSANELY attractive when someone is connected to themselves, when they are relating. The magnetism is in our body language and connection to our body.',

    title: 'How to Ask for Anything You Want in the Bedroom',
    description:
      'Asking for what you desire can be intimidating. Maybe you find it easier to please others, or you fear being needy or rejected. Especially in sex, where we often rely on telepathy! In this workshop, we’ll explore the joy and art of asking. When we engage clearly with others, it can make giving and receiving (in the bedroom, in dating, in our relationships…. ) feel so much more pleasurable.',

    title: 'How to Navigate Consent on the Dancefloor',
    description:
      'Our approach is to help make this dance even MORE playful by removing the blurry lines— and re-discovering your own agency in the dance. Rather than treading on eggshells, guessing your followers needs, complaining, pretending everything’s ok when it’s not…. We will empower you with tools & mindsets to make this dance feel comfortable & clear (e.g. if it’s “too sensual” “too rough” “too fast”). So you can laugh through the night, with ease— rather than worrying about landing a dance that doesn’t feel good.',

    title: 'Yes AND for a more creative sex life!',
    description:
      'Fast-paced, sexy, and full of laughter —not for the faint of heart! How familiar is it to feel performative in sex? To get out of your heads and into the present, join Haneen for a series of sex improv games (some involving fruit 🍇) to help you make light of sex scripts and bring more playful intimacy in the bedroom',

    title: 'How to Receive Authentic But Triggering Sh*t from Your Partner',
    description:
      "If you want to create a kinder communication culture in your relationship... We'll be practicing all our favourite triggered responses (cos who doesn't love a bit of drama, icing out, sulking, over-apologising!) AND how to transmute that 🪄 into empowered responses 🧙🏻",

    title: 'How to make Casual Dating work for you',
    description:
      'I hear so many challenges around not feeling respected, not knowing how to be clear about your casual interest, fear of getting “emotionally involved” and complicating things or fear of coming across as creepy so you avoid expressing interest. In this workshop, Paulina and I are here to start paving a relationship to casual sex that is easeful, playful, and clear.',
