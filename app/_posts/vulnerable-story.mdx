title: A vulnerable story from me today
description: “I want to have sex with someone but my partner feels uncomfortable about it. What do I do?” 🍆👩🏽‍🤝‍👨🏼 Perhaps reading this will put words to things you experience (even if you're monogamous). Or perhaps you'll learn a thing or two about processing jealousy, hard emotions & conflicting needs….. in any case, I hope it's valuable! 🫶🏻🤓
