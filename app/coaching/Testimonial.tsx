          Haneen is exactly the kind of sex and intimacy coach you would want -
          she is a wonderful listener, asks great curious questions and embodies
          a humble confidence when it comes to talking about all things sex! It
          is not a topic many find easy to discuss but she does it with so much
          warmth, playfulness and openness! She is also an incredible source of
          knowledge and experience.
