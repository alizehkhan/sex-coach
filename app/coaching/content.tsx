          After you fill an intake form, I&apos;ll draw up a roadmap that will
          steer us over the 7 sessions and make clear your goal and the skills
          for us to work on.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          A coaching session usually opens with you sharing what&apos;s been
          happening for you lately in your sex/dating life. We&apos;ll then
          choose an area to focus for the hour. From there we&apos;ll do a
          mixture of reflecting and interactive exercises. I don&apos;t just
          engage in “talk” - I will often ask you to check how your body is
          responding to a certain question or situation! If it&apos;s a more
          therapeutic session, we&apos;ll follow a flow inspired by Internal
          Family Systems therapy. If it&apos;s more “teach-y”, I&apos;ll get us
          to practice certain tools or communication role-plays.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Most of the time the session is tailored to what&apos;s built upon
          since the last session, that help us move towards our goal.

          Depending on how you learn best and what our goal is, I could set you
          a chapter to read (e.g. about sex drive types), a podcast (e.g. how to
          feel your feelings, or what your erotic blueprint is) or a framework
          to nerd on. I will supplement that with a practical exercise, which
          could include:
        </p>
        <ul className="pl-6 mt-4">
          <li>👉🏼 The 3 minute game with a friend</li>
          <li>👉🏼 A pleasure/touch based exercise </li>
          <li>👉🏼 Actively practicing a skill we&apos;ve learnt</li>
          <li>👉🏼 reflecting on questions I&apos;ve set</li>
          <li>👉🏼 a conversation to have with your partner</li>
          <li>👉🏼 tracking parts in yourself that are activated!</li>

        You will only ever be invited to share 😊 It&apos;s up to you how much!
        All my clients have felt comfortable to share about their sex life (I
        have pretty much heard it all 😉) Where relevant, I will share just as
        candidly too, so it doesn&apos;t feel one-sided!

        In my experience video calls have been just as effective as face-to-face
        sessions. ❤️ So my practice has been 95% online. There&apos;s also the
        fact that I&apos;m nomadic so it&apos;s a little harder to catch me
        in-person. 😂

        <p>
          I would suggest a minimum of 7 sessions. Usually clients renew on a
          rolling-basis after for a total of 12-15 sessions.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          This depends on our relationship together, the depth of your goal, and
          where you are on the journey. Some clients may need more time to work.
          The key is to not rush the process and to give yourself time to
          reflect on what you&apos;re really thinking and feeling.

          Great question! I have found there are a few key conditions to
          accelerating the journey:
        </p>
        <ul className="pl-6 mt-4">
          <li>
            👉🏼 You have a certain level of self-awareness in place already (this
            is not your first “self development” investment)
          </li>
          <li>👉🏼 You&apos;re keen to do the homework in between class</li>
          <li>
            👉🏼 You proactively schedule sessions with me that are 2-4 weeks
            apart.
          </li>
          <li>
            👉🏼 You are willing to be honest, reflect and FEEL your feelings.
          </li>
          <li>
            👉🏼 You&apos;re willing to take small risks during our sessions that
            feel outside your comfort zone!
          </li>
          <li>
            👉🏼 You reflect on the discussions we have after sessions and share
            them with me (where relevant)
          </li>
        </ul>

        Nope, sex & intimacy coaching is fully clothed with no touch involved.

          The rest of the time I&apos;ll ask you juicy questions about the area
          of sex / dating you&apos;ve come to me for! I will help you breakdown
          what is going on (i.e. what you&apos;re not seeing) and what&apos;s
          in-between you and your goal — so you have more clarity. We&apos;ll

        Yes, it can be super complementary to work with a therapist and a coach.
